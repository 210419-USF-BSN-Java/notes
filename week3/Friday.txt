JavaScript
	- a scripting language for client-side web applications
		- can also be used server side
		- scripting language, an interpreted language
			- not compiled, no intermediate step/no compilation process
			- JIT - Just In Time compilation
		- supported by all modern browsers
	- ECMA, manages the standard specification for JS
		- these standards are called ECMAScript
		- ES6, ES7, introduce new functionality to JS
	- Multi-paradigmed
		- functional programming, OO...
	- Dynamically/Weakly typed
		- variables don't have to be declared with any specific type, their type can be changed dynamically
			- type coersion: evaluating 4 == '4' will return true
			- to avoid type coersion use ===
	- semi-colon injections: puts semi-colons at the end of statements implicitely when it feels appropriate
		- helpful to avoid running into issues by placing semi colons explicitely
	- Types
		- "primitive"
			- boolean
			- number
			- null
			- undefined
			- symbol
			- string
		- "object"
			- objects
				- stored as key-value pairs
				- very similar to JSON
					- {
						"id":5,
						"name":"Name"
					  }
			- arrays
			- functions

		- Truthy and Falsy(?)
			- Any type in JS will evaluate to either true or false
			- Falsy values
				- null
				- undefined
				- 0
				- "" - empty strings
				- false
				- NaN (not a number)
	- Ways to include js into an HTML page
		- between <script> enter script here </script> in html doc
		- externally <script src="path/to/jsFile"></script>
			- use defer to delay loading the scripts
