Type of Client Server Architecture:
	-2-tier architecture
		-Client/application tier and DB tier
	3-tier architecture
		-Presentation Layer/ Application Layer/ Data Layer
		-separation of concerns
		-ie: any webapp
	-n-tier architecture
		-breaking down application in additional layers based on logic to decouple different aspects of the application
		-can lead to complexity
	
HTTP
	-transfer protocol used for information exchange over the world wide web
	-consists of Request and Responses exchanged between a Client and a Server
	-HyperText Transfer Protocol
	-file types: JSON, XML, HTML pages, plain text
	-HTTP request
		-HTTP version
			-current 1 /1.1
		-Verb
			-also known as HTTP methods, describes the operation to be performed
			-4 main ones
				-like CRUD
				-GET - retrieve
				-POST - create
				-PUT - update
				-DELETE - delete
		-URL
			-resource location
		-Header
			-metadata about the request
		-Body
			-can be empty
			-information that you might want to include
	-HTTP response
		-HTTP Version
		-Header
			-metadata about the response
		-Body
			-Payload (if requesting a resource)
			-can be empty
		-Status codes
			-provide information on the status of the request
			-100s - 500s
				-100s: informational
				-200s: success
				-300s: redirect
				-400s: client-side error
				-500s: server-side error

VSCode extension for Tomcat: Tomcat for Java

Maven command to generate a webapp archetype: mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DarchetypeVersion=1.4

Tomcat(8.5)
	- webserver: processes client requests and sends back responses
	- provides a web server environment in which Java code, packaged within a web archive(WAR), can run.
		- There is no main method in a war file
	- Catalina
		- Component of Tomcat
		- Tomcat's servlet container
			- manages our servlets and their lifecycle

Servlets
	- objects used to handle requests and responses
	- servlets are not part of the Java standard library
		- javax.servlets(java extensions)
	- servlet hierarchy:
		- Servlet (I)
			|
			- declare the lifecycle methods of a servlet
				- init - initializes the servlet, called once
					- called when a request is made the specific servlet does not have an instance
				- service - called every time a request is received, handles the request
				- destroy - called when the servlet is no longer needed, called once
			|
		- Generic Servlet (AC)
			- default implementation of init and destroy are provided
			|
		- HTTP Servlet (AC)
			- declares and implements doGet/doPost/doPut/doDelete, routed from the service method 
			|
		- YourServletImplementation (CC)
			- 
	- deployment descriptor (web.xml)
		- file that defines and maps the servlets so that the web container knows where to find them and what request to send them
		- <servlet>
			<servlet-name>name</servlet-name>
			<servlet-class>com.revature.servlets.name</servlet-class>
			<load-on-startup>0</load-on-startup>
		  </servlet>
		  <servlet-mapping>
			<servlet-name>name</servlet-name>
			<url-pattern>/endpoint</url-pattern
		  </servlet-mapping>
		- load on startup
			- allows to set the web container to call the init lifecycle for a servlet before the application starts rather than waiting for the first request.
	- PrintWriter
		- object that is retrieved from the response object
			- response.getWriter();
		- can write to the response body using .write()
		- can write in plain text, in JSON, HTML... whatever is relevant to your application
	
JSON
	- JavaScript Object Notation
	- Often the preferred format for information transfer
	- {"key":value, "key2":value2 }

Object mappers
	- Jackson library is used in order to convert our Java Objects into JSON and vice versa

HTML
	- hypertext markup language
	- used to define the structure of a webpage using html tags
	- basic structure of an html document
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<head>
				metadata
			</head>
			<body>
				anything to be displayed on the webpage
			</body>
		</html>
	- tags - represent elements
	- attributes - properties of elements <div style="" width=""> </div>
	- DOM - Document Object Model
		- Tree like structure that represents the html document
	- HTML5
		- No longer have to use a doctype declaration
		- Semantic elements
	- div - generic block
	- a - href attribute, makes link on a webpage
	- br - line break, self closing
	- img - src attribute, self closing
	- ol/ul - ordered vs unordered lists
	- table - tables
	- form - to create a form to capture user input, action and method attribute
