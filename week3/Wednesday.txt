Servlet cont. 
	- POST request
		- query params vs request body
			- query params: url?key=value
				- not safe, visible in the url
			- request body
				- information sent is "hidden" in the body
			- path params: url/{path-param}
				- visible in the url
	- views
		- views should be located in the webapp folder of your application
			- can be accessed directly via end point
			- can be returned from servlet
				- forward vs redirect
					- redirect: 2 reqs/ 2responses (1st response being a 300s)
						- use when not "part" of your application
							- ie: an associate asks you a question and you redirect them to google
					- forward: 1 req/ 1res send the request and response object to a different part of your application
						- ie: to a view, to another servlet... etc
