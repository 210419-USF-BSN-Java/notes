Docker
	- Tool revolving around the idea of containerization
		- used to develop and deploy applications using containers
	- Support on Linux
		- Toolbox allows for support on other OSes
	- Follows a Client-Server architecture
		- Docker Client/Docker Daemon

Container
	- Standardized unit of software
	- Abstraction at the app layer that packages the code and dependencies together
		- Multiple containers can run on the same Docker Engine and share the same Host OS with each other
			- each container runs as an isolated process
				- 
			- lightweight and scalable
			- More efficient use of resources
	- CONTAINERS ARE DIFFERENT FROM VIRTUAL MACHINES

Terminology
	- Docker Daemon
		- background service running on the OS that manages building/running Docker containers
		- interacted with using Docker Client
	- Docker Client
		- command line tool used to interact with Docker daemon
			- docker build
			- docker ...
	- Dockerfile
		- a simple text file that contains a list of command to create a Docker image
		- note: a dockerfile does not have a file extention
	- Images 
		- blueprint of an application to create a container
		- includes everything needed to run an application, the code, runtime, dependencies...
	- Containers
		- a running process, isolated from the host and from other containers
		- each container interacts with its own "private" filesystem provided by a Docker image
	- Docker Hub
		- an online registry and VCS of Docker Images
			- docker pull
			- docker push
	- Docker Volume
		- preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers
			- can be shared between containers

Dockerfile Commands
	- FROM [base-image]
		- image to be built upon/ usually with the runtime environment needed to run an application
			- ie: Java Runtime
		- at top of Dockerfile
	- ADD [url]
		- if a file from online is needed
		- wget equivalent/ download file from a url
	- COPY [Host filesystem] [Container filesystem]
		- used to copy files into the container's file system
	- ENV
		- used to specify environment variables
	- LABEL
		- for metadata
	- WORKDIR
		- Specify a workdirectory
	- CMD/RUN
		- Run commands ie: sudo yum update....
	- ENTRYPOINT
		- can be used to specify the entrypoint to app

	- CMD/RUN/ENTRYPOINT
		- can be used all used to run commands, have slight different application.


Docker Workflow
	- Dockerfile -> docker build -t(to specify image name) [name] -> Docker image -> docker run -p(specify port) -d(detached mode) [image-name] -> Docker Container
	Alternatively
	- retrieve an image from DockerHub using: docker pull [image-name] -> Docker image -> docker run -p(specify port) -d(detached mode) [image-name] -> Docker Container

Basic Docker Commands
	- docker
		- displays a list of available commands
	- docker ps
		- displays running containers
	- docker images
		- displays available images
	- docker build
		- builds an image from a dockerfile
	- docker run
		- creates a container from an image
	- docker stop
		- stops a container
	- docker pull/push
		- pull/pushes an image from/to DockerHub
