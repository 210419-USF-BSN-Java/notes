Vertical Scaling
	- "More power"

Horizontal Scaling
	- More instances

MSA (MicroService Architecture)
	- Breaking down larger "monolithic" application into smaller/independent services (decoupled)
		- decomposing applications into single-function modules with well defined interfaces which are independently deployed and communicating via open protocols
			- ie: Netflix
	- Monolith vs MSA
	 	- Monolith
			- System simplicity
			- More centralized control
			- Less network traffic
			- ACID transaction
		- MSA
			- Higher fault tolerance
				- ie: an exception does not take down all of the other services/ more durable
			- More efficient resource allocation and scalability
				- can scale a specific aspect of the application, as needed, rather than the whole thing
			- Not tied to one particular tech stack
				- ie: if all services are Restful, tech stack used to create the service do not matter as long as JSON data is taken in and returned
			- Modularity
				- benefit maintenance
				- easy to replace/upgrade
			- Eventual Consistency
				- multiple dbs may have to be updated
	- Disadvantages of MSA
		- Complex infrastructure
		- Chatty interfaces
			- Lot of interservice communication over a network
		- Lack of transactional operation (ACID)
			- BASE (Basic Availability, Soft state, and Eventual Consistency)
