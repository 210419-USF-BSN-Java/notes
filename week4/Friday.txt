Hibernate (continued)

Criteria API
	- Java-based, used to query data programmatically
		- DQL
		- keeps languages separated
		- OOP "manner"

Named Queries
	- Defining a query to be used in the model
	- Used when data might not be separated in a different layer
		- easy to find (in the model)
	
Caching
	- "Storing for quicker access"
	- Stores the result of a query from the db to save time
		- "buffer memory" that lies between the application and the database
	- Types of caching in Hibernate
		- L1 - Level 1
			- Session level
			- Automatic and mandatory
			- if multiple updates are made onto an object, 
				Hibernate delayes the actual db update as long as possible to reduce the number of statements used
			- Closing the session causes the information in L1 caching to be lost
		- L2 - Level 2
			- Session factory level
				- lasts for the entire lifetime of your application
			- Optional
			- Need to leverage 3rd cache
				- ie: ehcache
			- to configure, in the hibernate.cfg.xml in the session-factory tag
