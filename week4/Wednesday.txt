AWS
	- Amazon Web Services
	- Offers cloud solutions to customer needs
	- Why cloud?
 		- cost saving
			- not have to manage servers on-premise
				- staff
				- maintaining, upgrading hardware...
		- Infrastruture
		- Scalability
			- Auto-scaling
				- "Pay for what you use, can adapt for short term needs"
		- Durability
	Regions and Availability zones
		- Regions: groupings of AWS zones available worldwide
		- Availibity zones: data centers containting infrastructure
	
	Cloud computing models
		- models in which cloud services can be provided
			- https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/platform-as-a-service-paas/
		- IaaS
			- Infrastructure as a Service
			- user needs to provide and manage: Application, Data, Runtime...
				- ie: EC2
		- PaaS
			- Platform as a Service
			- user needs to provide and manage: Application Data
				- ie: RDS
		- SaaS
			- Software as a Service
			- everything is abstracted away
				- ie: Gmail

DevOps
	- is a set of practices that combines software development with IT operations
	- goal is to produce "high quality code" more efficiently
	- Often associated with Agile
	- build, test, deploy, maintain software
	- DevOps pipelines
		- is a set of automated processes and tools that allows developers and operations 
		professionals to collaborate on building and deploying code to a production environment.

CI
	- Continuous Integration
	- practice of constantly merging source code, often in a centralized location/repository
		- meant to prevent large errors from accumulating
		- make sure that people work with the latest codebase
CD
	- Continuous Delivery
	- Constantly having the application/software is a state to be released "at the push of a button"
		- Staging environment
CD
	- Continuous Deployment
	- Code is integrated if it passes the tests and is immediately sent to the production environment
		- live/production environment

Maven (review)
	- Build automation tool and dependency management tool
		- dependencies are downloaded locally in the .m2 folder
	- Lifecycle:
		- clean - "project cleaning"/ removing old artifacts
		- default
			- broken down into "phases"
				- validate - makes sure that all the necessary information is available
				- compile - compiling the source code
				- test - testing the compiled code, unit test (JUnit)
				- package - takes the compiled code and packages it into a distributable format (jar/war)
				- verify - integration tests
				- install - install onto local repository
				- deploy - deploys to remote repository for other developers to access
		- site - project documentation

Jenkins
	- Open-sourced automation server, build automation tool
		- can automate CI/CD/CD processes
	- Can leverage plugins in order to achieve additional functionality
		- Notifications for passing/failing builds
	- Jenkins job
		- project managed by jenkins, set of repeatable steps automated by jenkins
			- ie: pulling latest code, testing code, building artifact, deploying onto tomcat
			- Build trigger: define when the job would run/executed
		- Build status
			- blue - success
			- yellow - unstable
			- red - failure
		- Weather forcast
			- "how often builds pass/fail"
