Git 
	- Version Control tool used to manage source code, it can save snapshots of a project on one or more branching paths
		- Repository: files, folders, objects and the branches that represent a project which is managed with a .git folder
		- Working directory: currently active project files and folder 
		- Staging Area: Area between working directory and repository where the changes that you make are added before the next commit
		- Commit: Snapshot of the staged changes from a working directory
	
	- Git workflow
		- git init - initializes a repository (creates a .git folder)
		- git add - adds the changes made to the Staging area to be prepped
			- git rm - removes file from being commited
		- git commit - the changes are saved onto the local repository ( -m to add a message )
		- git push - pushes the changes onto the remote repository
		- git status - see which files are new and which files are staged to be commited
		
		- git branch - list available branches
		- git checkout - navigate between branches ( -b to create a new branch )
		- git pull - pulls anything that is new in the main branch

cd: change directory (.., . , ~ , /)
ls: list content of the directory ( -a, shows hidden files )
mkdir: make directories
touch: creates files
cat: read files
cp: copy files/directories
mv: move files/ rename
rm: remove files (-rf to remove directories)
pwd: prints the current working directory
man: manual to find more information about a command

Absolute path: points to a location in the file system regardless if the current directory, from root directory (/)
Relative path: points to a location in the file system based on the current directory
